chart_analysis,"The image displays a graph with various mathematical equations written on it. These equations are labeled as Q, q, H, h, W, w, and Q\_w. There is also an equation that reads ""Q\_w = Q \* w"". The graph appears to be focused on the relationship between these variables, possibly related to physics or mathematics.","Analyze this chart or scientific diagram in detail. Describe the data, labels, axes, trends, and any text elements you can see. Focus on accuracy and completeness.",2.516615629196167,74,True,,,800,3.0,,1.1,0.3,0.9
technical_description,"The image displays a mathematical equation written in a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. The equation appears to be related to the concept of quantum mechanics, as indicated by the presence of the letter ""h"" and the use of the symbol ""w"". 

There are several instances of the letter ""w"" in the equation, along with other letters such as ""q"" and ""k"". Additionally, there are multiple instances of the number ""2"" scattered throughout the equation. Overall, the equation seems to be a complex representation of a quantum mechanics concept.","Provide a technical description of this image. Identify all text, numbers, symbols, and structural elements. Be precise and systematic in your analysis.",4.35347580909729,118,False,True,1.0,600,,3.0,1.15,,
comprehensive_caption,"The equation shown here is an example of the physics concept known as ""hysteresis"". This concept describes how materials exhibit non-linear behavior when subjected to cyclic loading conditions. It can be applied in various fields such as electrical engineering, mechanical design, and material science.","Create a comprehensive caption for this image. Include all visible text, data points, chart elements, and contextual information. Make it suitable for academic or technical documentation.",2.2011466026306152,60,True,,,1000,4.0,,1.2,0.4,0.95
structured_analysis,"The image displays several equations and symbols on a white background. There are two primary sets of equations separated by vertical lines. One set is located towards the left side of the image, while the other is positioned more centrally. Additionally, there is a smaller set of equations near the top right corner.

There are also various letters and numbers scattered throughout the image. Some letters can be seen in the central and bottom parts of the picture, while others are placed at different positions within the frame. The numerical values are present in multiple locations, with some appearing in the lower part of the scene and others situated higher up.","Analyze this image using a structured approach: 1) Identify the main elements, 2) Describe any text or labels, 3) Note data patterns or trends, 4) Summarize the overall purpose.",4.435103893280029,128,True,,,700,3.0,,1.1,0.5,0.9
precision_focused,"The image displays a mathematical equation written in a foreign language. The equation consists of several variables, including letters, numbers, and symbols such as the letter ""H"" and the number ""W."" The equation is written in a complex manner, making it difficult to understand without knowledge of the specific language.","Describe this image with high precision.
