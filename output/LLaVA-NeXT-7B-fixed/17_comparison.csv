chart_analysis,"The image displays a table with several columns of data. There are three main columns that seem to be related to the same topic. One column is labeled ""Before Perurb,"" another is titled ""All SEQ,"" and the third one reads ""After Perurb."" These columns likely represent different stages of a process or experiment.

The table contains various numbers and percentages, indicating measurements taken during each stage. For example, the ""Before"" column shows a percentage of 67%, while the ""After"" column has a percentage value of 95%. This suggests that there might have been an improvement in the outcome after the intervention.","Analyze this chart or scientific diagram in detail.

technical_description,"The image displays a series of graphs and tables, likely related to scientific research or data analysis. There are three main graphs in the image, with each graph showing different sets of data.

The first graph is located on the left side of the image, while the second graph is positioned in the middle, and the third graph is on the right side. Each graph is accompanied by a table, providing additional information and context for the data being presented.

In addition to the graphs and tables, there are several numbers and percentages scattered throughout the image. These numbers and percentages likely represent various aspects of the research or data being analyzed. Overall, the image conveys a sense of scientific inquiry and data presentation.","Provide a technical description of this image. Identify all text, numbers, symbols, and structural elements.

comprehensive_caption,"The image displays several graphs with various data sets on them. There is an x-y graph that shows the relationship between two variables over time. Another graph presents a comparison of different factors in relation to each other. Additionally, there are three bar charts illustrating distinct aspects of the data being analyzed. These visual representations provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns present within the dataset.","Create a comprehensive caption for this image.

structured_analysis,"The image consists of three tables displaying various data and statistics. Each table is focused on different aspects of the information presented. There are multiple columns with numerical values, such as percentages, in each table.

The first table seems to be about a large database, possibly related to an organization. This table has a total of six rows, which include information like ""Base Inter"", ""Large Database"", and other data points.
The second table appears to be a comparison between two sets of data. It has four rows, with the first row being labeled ""Before Perurb"". The remaining three rows have numbers and text that seem to represent the differences between the two sets.
Lastly, the third table contains data related to a project, including a description of the project's progress. It features five rows of information, some of which are labeled with specific details about the project.","Analyze this image using a structured approach: 1) Identify the main elements, 2) Describe any text or labels, 3) Note data patterns or trends, 4) Summarize the overall purpose.",6.1434338092803955,183,True,,,700,3.0,,1.1,0.5,0.9
