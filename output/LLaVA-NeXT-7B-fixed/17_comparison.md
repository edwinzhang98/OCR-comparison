## Results Comparison

### chart_analysis

**Prompt:** Analyze this chart or scientific diagram in detail. Describe the data, labels, axes, trends, and any text elements you can see. Focus on accuracy and completeness.

**Output:** The image displays a table with several columns of data. There are three main columns that seem to be related to the same topic. One column is labeled "Before Perurb," another is titled "All SEQ," and the third one reads "After Perurb." These columns likely represent different stages of a process or experiment.

The table contains various numbers and percentages, indicating measurements taken during each stage. For example, the "Before" column shows a percentage of 67%, while the "After" column has a percentage value of 95%. This suggests that there might have been an improvement in the outcome after the intervention.

### structured_analysis

**Prompt:** Analyze this image using a structured approach: 1) Identify the main elements, 2) Describe any text or labels, 3) Note data patterns or trends, 4) Summarize the overall purpose.

**Output:** The image consists of three tables displaying various data and statistics. Each table is focused on different aspects of the information presented. There are multiple columns with numerical values, such as percentages, in each table.

The first table seems to be about a large database, possibly related to an organization. This table has a total of six rows, which include information like "Base Inter", "Large Database", and other data points.
The second table appears to be a comparison between two sets of data. It has four rows, with the first row being labeled "Before Perurb". The remaining three rows have numbers and text that seem to represent the differences between the two sets.
Lastly, the third table contains data related to a project, including a description of the project's progress. It features five rows of information, some of which are labeled with specific details about the project.

**Inference Time:** 6.14s
**Total Tokens:** 183

**Generation Parameters:**
- max_new_tokens: 700
- do_sample: True
- temperature: 0.5
- top_p: 0.9
