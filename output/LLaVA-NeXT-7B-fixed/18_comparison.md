### structured_analysis

**Prompt:** Analyze this image using a structured approach: 1) Identify the main elements, 2) Describe any text or labels, 3) Note data patterns or trends, 4) Summarize the overall purpose.

**Output:** The image features two equations on a white background, each with an "f" in them. One equation is positioned to the left of the other, while both are placed above a horizontal line that divides the frame into three sections. The first section consists of the top half of the image, where the second equation resides; the second section is located below the horizontal line and contains only one equation; and finally, the third section spans from the bottom left corner to the right edge of the frame.
