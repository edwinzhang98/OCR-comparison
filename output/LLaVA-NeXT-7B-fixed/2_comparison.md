### chart_analysis

**Prompt:** Analyze this chart or scientific diagram in detail. Describe the data, labels, axes, trends, and any text elements you can see. Focus on accuracy and completeness.

**Output:** The image depicts a flowchart with multiple boxes and arrows connecting them. Each box represents a different concept or process, while the arrows indicate connections between these concepts. There are also time-related elements present, such as clocks indicating specific times throughout the flowchart.

The flowchart is organized into several sections, including "Self Attention," "Queen," "Ghetto," and "Token." These sections represent distinct stages of the process being described. Additionally, there is a section titled "Per Cell Position" that appears to be related to cell positioning within the flow. Overall, the flowcharts provide a clear visual representation of various processes and their interconnectedness.

### technical_description

**Prompt:** Provide a technical description of this image. Identify all text, numbers, symbols, and structural elements. Be precise and systematic in your analysis.

**Output:** The image depicts a flowchart or diagram, possibly related to computer science or data processing. The flowchart consists of multiple arrows pointing in various directions, indicating different steps or processes.

There are several labels on the flowchart, such as "self attention," "queen," "screwed," "up," "token," and "rank." These labels likely correspond to specific stages or actions within the flowchart.

In addition to the arrows and labels, there are two clocks visible in the flowchart. One clock is positioned near the top-left corner, while the other is located in the top-right corner. These clocks may represent time-related aspects of the flowchart or serve as a visual aid for understanding the sequence of events.

### comprehensive_caption

**Prompt:** Create a comprehensive caption for this image. Include all visible text, data points, chart elements, and contextual information. Make it suitable for academic or technical documentation.

**Output:** The graph depicts the relationship between self-attention (SA) and query length in terms of time spent on each task. There are two main sections within the graph - one with purple labels labeled "Query" and another section titled "Self Attn." These labels represent different aspects of the process being analyzed.

The x-axis displays various lengths of queries from left to right, while the y-axis shows corresponding times spent on tasks related to these query lengths. This visual representation helps illustrate how the amount of time spent increases as the query length grows longer.

### structured_analysis

**Prompt:** Analyze this image using a structured approach: 1) Identify the main elements, 2) Describe any text or labels, 3) Note data patterns or trends, 4) Summarize the overall purpose.

**Output:** The image displays an infographic that illustrates various concepts related to self-attention and query length. There are several diagrams in the graphic, with one on the left side focusing on the "query length" aspect of the topic. Another diagram is located towards the right side of the image, which emphasizes the concept of "self-attentions." Additionally, there's a clock placed at the top center of the graph, possibly representing time as it relates to the discussed topics. Overall, the infographic provides a visual representation of the relationship between query length and self-attendees.

**Inference Time:** 4.35s
**Total Tokens:** 127

**Generation Parameters:**
- max_new_tokens: 700
- do_sample: True
- temperature: 0.5

### precision_focused

**Prompt:** Describe this image with high precision. Pay special attention to exact text, numbers, symbols, and spatial relationships. Avoid speculation and focus on observable facts.

**Output:** The image depicts a visual representation of a computer system, focusing on the self-attention mechanism. There are two main diagrams in the image, one on the left side and the other on the right side.

The left-side diagram is titled "self-attention," while the right-side diagram is labeled "queen." Both diagrams feature multiple arrows pointing in various directions, indicating the flow of information within the computer system.

In addition to the main diagrams, there are several smaller diagrams scattered throughout the image. These smaller diagrams likely provide more detailed information about the computer system's components and processes.

**Inference Time:** 5.20s
