chart_analysis,"The image displays a table with two columns of numbers. In one column, there are four sets of numbers that represent the number of parasites per base. These numbers vary from 1 to 25. In the other column, the numbers represent the size of the parasite bases, ranging from 340 to 1,360 meters. There is also a smaller set of numbers in the middle of the table, which might be related to the paraspore measurements. Overall, the table provides information about the sizes and counts of paraspores found in different samples.","Analyze this chart or scientific diagram in detail. Describe the data, labels, axes, trends, and any text elements you can see. Focus on accuracy and completeness.",4.269614934921265,124,True,,,800,3.0,,1.1,0.3,0.9
technical_description,"The image displays a table with two rows of data. The first row consists of three columns, while the second row has four columns. Each column represents a different aspect of the data.

In the first row, the first column is labeled ""Model,"" the second column is ""Number of Parameters,"" and the third column is ""Number of Parameres."" In the second row, the first column is ""Former Base,"" the second column is ""Largest,"" the third column is ""340,"" and the fourth column is ""251.""

The table is organized in a way that allows for easy comparison and understanding of the data.","Provide a technical description of this image. Identify all text, numbers, symbols, and structural elements. Be precise and systematic in your analysis.",5.0448899269104,138,False,True,1.0,600,,3.0,1.15,,
comprehensive_caption,"The image displays two graphs showing the number of parabolas in each graph. Each graph has different values displayed on them. One of the graphs is labeled ""former base,"" while the other one is not provided with any label. There are also several numbers scattered throughout both graphs that might represent specific measurements related to these parabolic models.","Create a comprehensive caption for this image. Include all visible text, data points, chart elements, and contextual information. Make it suitable for academic or technical documentation.",2.369626998901367,70,True,,,1000,4.0,,1.2,0.4,0.95
structured_analysis,"The image displays a table with two columns and four rows of numbers. In each row, there are three numbers that appear to be measurements or distances. The first column contains a list of model names, while the second column provides additional information such as number of parabolas or the name ""former base."" There is also a label at the top left corner indicating that it is a ""PASLARGE"" model. The purpose of this table seems to be to compare different models based on their specifications and characteristics.","Analyze this image using a structured approach: 1) Identify the main elements, 2) Describe any text or labels, 3) Note data patterns or trends, 4) Summarize the overall purpose.",3.6763768196105957,106,True,,,700,3.0,,1.1,0.5,0.9
precision_focused,"The image displays a comparison between two large bases, one being the former base and the other being the current base. The former base has a height of 340 meters, while the current base has a height of 110 meters. There is a significant difference in height between the two bases.

In addition to the height comparison, the image also shows the number of parasols in each base. The former base has 13 parasols, while the current base has 12 parasols. The differences in the number of parasols between the two bases are also highlighted in the image.","Describe this image with high precision. Pay special attention to exact text, numbers, symbols, and spatial relationships. Avoid speculation and focus on observable facts.",4.881145000457764,130,False,True,1.1,500,,4.0,1.2,,
