| concise_default | user Describe the figure precisely. assistant The figure is a table comparing the performance of two models, TAPASBASE and TABLEFORMERBASE, before and after perturbation. The performance is measured in terms of accuracy for "ALL" and "SEQ" tasks, as well as the percentage of variance explained (VP) for the "VP" task. | You are an expert science figure and chart captioner.

| long_detailed | user Describe the figure precisely. assistant The image is a table comparing the performance of two models, TAPASBASE and TABLEFORMERBASE, before and after perturbation. The table is divided into two main columns: "Before Perturb" and "After Perturb." Under each model, there are three sub-columns labeled "ALL," "SEQ," and "VP."  For TAPABASE: - Before Perturb:    - ALL: 61.1   - SEQ: 31.3 - After Perturb:   - VP: 14.0%   - Other values: 57.4, 34.6, 2p, 4p, and 16p  For TABLEFORMEBASE:  - Before and after Perturb values are: - ALL: Both 66.7 - SEQ: Before 39.7, After 0.1% - VP: Before and After are both 1.0%  The table shows that the performance metrics (ALL, SEQ, and VP) for both models change after the perturbation, with some values increasing and others decreasing. | Analyze the figure carefully and write a detailed caption. Include key entities, labels/values, and trends. Avoid hallucination; describe only what is visible. | False | 768 | 3 | 3 | 1.07 |  |  |

| creative_sample | user Describe the figure precisely. assistant The figure is a table that presents the results of a comparison between two models, `TAPASBASE` and `TABLEFORMERBASE`, before and after perturbation. The table is divided into two main sections: "Before Perturb" and "After Perturb." Each section is further divided into three columns: "ALL," "SEQ," and "VP."  ### Axes and Units: - **X-axis:** Not explicitly labeled, but it represents different perturbation levels (1p, 2p, ..., 16p). - **Y-axis:** Represents the accuracy scores for each model.  ### Labels: - The table header includes the model names (`TAPABASE`, `TABLEBASE`, `TAPIBASE 1p`, `2p`, etc.) and the accuracy metrics (`ALL`, `SEQ`, `VP`). - The accuracy scores are given in percentages.  ### Visible Trends: 1. **Overall Accuracy (`ALL`):**    - `TAPPBASE` starts with an accuracy of 61.1% before perturbation and increases to 67.4% after perturbations.    - For `TABLEFOMERBASE` before perturb, the accuracy is 66.7%, which remains unchanged after perturbing.  2. **Sequential Accuracy (`SEQ`):**     - Similar to `ALL`, the sequential accuracy for `TAPA` increases after pertubation, while `TABLE` remains constant.  3. **Vulnerable Points (`VP`):**     - The `VP%` for `TABLEBAS` decreases from 14.0% to 9.9% after applying perturb.    For `TAPERBASE`, the VP% decreases from around 8.4 to 7.2%.    `TABLEFORMBASE` shows no change in VP%.  ### Conclusion: The table shows that perturbation generally improves the accuracy of both models, with `TAPTABASE` showing the most significant improvement. The `TABLEFOBEBASE` model remains relatively stable, with no significant changes in accuracy or vulnerability points. | Describe the chart with clarity. Mention axes, units, labels, and any visible trends. | True | 512 | 3 | 1 | 1.02 | 0.6 | 0.9 |
