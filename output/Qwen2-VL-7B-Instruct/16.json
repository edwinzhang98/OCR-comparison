The equation is:\n\n\\[ \\textbf{Atten}(H)=\\text{softmax}(\\textbf{\\textit{A}})\\textbf{T} \\]\n\nHere's a detailed description of the components of the equation:\n\n- **Atten(H)**: This represents the output of the Attention mechanism, which is a weighted sum of the input vectors.\n- **softmax(A)**: The softmax function is applied to the matrix \\(\\text{\\textbf A}\\). The softmax is a function that takes a vector of real numbers and transforms it into a probability distribution, where each element is between 0 and 1 and the sum of all elements is 1.\n- \\(\\mathbf{A}\\): This is a matrix that contains the scores or weights assigned to each element in the input sequence. These scores are typically computed based on the similarity between the input elements and a query vector.\n- \\( \\mathbf{T}\\): Represents the input to the attention layer, which could be a sequence of vectors.\n\nThe equation essentially states that the output \\( \\mathrm{Att}(H)\\) is obtained by applying the softmax function to the scores in matrix \\({\\mathbf A} \\), and then multiplying the resulting probabilities by the input \\(\\mathrm{T}\\).\n\nThis equation is fundamental in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and other areas of machine learning where attention mechanisms are used to focus on specific parts of the data that are most relevant for the task at hand."
