The formula is given as:\n\n\\[ VP = \\frac{(t2f + f2t)}{(t1t + t2f)} \\]\n\nHere's a detailed description of the components of the formula:\n\n- **\\( VP \\)**: This is the variable being calculated.\n- **Numerator**: The numerator of the fraction is \\( t2 \\cdot f + f \\cdot t \\).\n- **Denominator**: The denominator of the equation is \\( (t1 \\cdot 1 + t \\cdot \\cdot) \\).\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Variables**:\n   - \\( t1 \\): This could represent a time or a rate associated with the first term.\n   - **t2**: This could also represent a different time or rate associated in the second term.\n   \n2. **Factors**:\n    - \\( f \\): A factor that multiplies both terms in the numerator.\n    - **1**: This is a placeholder for another factor or constant that might be involved in the calculation.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThe formula suggests a relationship between two terms involving time and factors. The numerator combines two terms, each multiplied by the factor \\( f \\(, while the denominator combines two other terms, one of which is multiplied by \\( t \\) and the other by \\( f\\).\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nLet's assume some values for \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_{2} \\), and \\( f\\) to illustrate how this formula might be used:\n\n- Suppose \\( t{1} = 2 \\) seconds, \\( t {2} =3 \\)seconds, and \\(f = 4\\).\n  \nThen, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ \nVP = \\dfrac{(2 \\times 4 + 3 \\times4)}{(2+3)} = \\text{dfrac}{(8 + 12)}{5} = \\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided formula \\( VP =  \\frac{t2 \\, f + \\,f \\, t}{t1 + \\cdot} \\) represents a relationship where the variable \\(VP\\) is calculated based on the sum of products of time and factor terms in both the numerator and denominator. This type of formula is often used in physics, engineering, or any field where time and rate calculations are necessary."
